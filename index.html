<a>This is a project that may start up in the near future.

This version of BeatCenter will be more robust in some aspects, such as:

• A link that's easier to remember
• More general control over the website
• More organized
• Better design (as you may already know, the old BeatCenter design isn't that well, thanks Google Sites)
  
Until more development is actually put into this, you can go check out the pre-existing BeatCenter by clicking the button below:</a>
