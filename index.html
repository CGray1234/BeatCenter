<a>This is a project that may start up in the near future.</a>
<div></div>
<a>This version of BeatCenter will be more robust in some aspects, such as:</a>
<div></div>
<a>• A link that's easier to remember</a>
<div></div>
<a>• More general control over the website</a>
<div></div>
<a>• More organized</a>
<div></div>
<a>• Better design (as you may already know, the old BeatCenter design isn't that well, thanks Google Sites)</a>
<div></div>
